# Piper Sandbox

Small Python library, HTTP API, and optional web GUI for testing TTS voices with Piper. The default model is `es_MX-ald-medium`, a Latin American Spanish voice available in `rhasspy/piper-voices`.

The first generation automatically downloads the selected model into `PIPER_MODELS_DIR`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or 3.12 recommended.
- `piper` binary available in `PATH`, or `PIPER_BIN=/path/to/piper`.
- Web browser if you want to use the GUI.

Python 3.13 may work for the API, but `piper-tts` can fail because of binary dependencies such as `onnxruntime`.

## Local Installation

Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the library without Piper:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Install the library and try to include the `piper` executable from PyPI:

```bash
pip install -e '.[tts]'
```

Verify that `piper` exists:

```bash
piper --help
```

If it cannot be installed with `pip`, install the official Piper binary and make sure it is available in your `PATH`. You can also point directly to the binary:

```bash
export PIPER_BIN=/path/to/piper
```

## Configuration

Copy the environment example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Available variables:

```env
PIPER_HOST=127.0.0.1
PIPER_PORT=8000
PIPER_HOST_PORT=8000
PIPER_CONTAINER_NAME=piper-sandbox
PIPER_INSTALL_TARGET=.[tts]
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=both
PIPER_ENGINE_URL=
PIPER_CORS_ORIGIN=*
PIPER_MODELS_DIR=models/piper
PIPER_HF_BASE=https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main
PIPER_DEFAULT_MODEL=es_MX-ald-medium
PIPER_MODEL_NAMES=["es_MX-claude-high","es_MX-ald-medium","es_ES-carlfm-x_low"]
# PIPER_BIN=/usr/local/bin/piper
PIPER_CHUNKS_ENABLED=false
PIPER_CHUNK_TARGET_CHARS=350
PIPER_CHUNK_MIN_CHARS=120
PIPER_CHUNK_MAX_CHARS=700
```

`PIPER_PORT` is the port used by the Python process inside the container or when running locally. `PIPER_HOST_PORT` is the port exposed on the host machine by Docker Compose.

Example:

```env
PIPER_PORT=8000
PIPER_HOST_PORT=8001
```

With Docker Compose this means:

```text
host:8001 -> container:8000
```

You would access the service from your browser or API client at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8001
```

If you are not using Docker, `PIPER_HOST_PORT` is not used and usually only `PIPER_PORT` matters.

`PIPER_SERVICE_MODE` controls which part of the app is exposed:

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=both
```

Available modes:

- `both`: serves the engine endpoints and the web GUI from the same process.
- `engine`: serves only `/health`, `/models`, and `/speak`.
- `gui`: serves only the web GUI. The GUI calls the remote engine defined by `PIPER_ENGINE_URL`.

To run only the engine API:

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=engine
```

To run only the GUI and point it to a remote engine:

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=gui
PIPER_ENGINE_URL=https://tts-engine.example.com
```

You can also use flags:

```bash
python -m piper_sandbox.api --mode both
python -m piper_sandbox.api --mode engine
python -m piper_sandbox.api --mode gui --engine-url https://tts-engine.example.com
python -m piper_sandbox.api --no-gui
python -m piper_sandbox.api --gui
```

`PIPER_ENABLE_GUI=true|false` is still supported for compatibility, but `PIPER_SERVICE_MODE` is preferred.

`PIPER_CORS_ORIGIN` controls the CORS header returned by the engine. Keep `*` for simple public testing, or restrict it to your GUI origin in production:

```env
PIPER_CORS_ORIGIN=https://tts-gui.example.com
```

### Chunked TTS Streaming

`PIPER_CHUNKS_ENABLED=true` activates the additive `POST /speak/chunks` endpoint described below. The existing `/speak` endpoint is unchanged regardless of this flag. The GUI reads `chunks_enabled` from `/health` on load and automatically picks the chunked path when available.

```env
PIPER_CHUNKS_ENABLED=true
PIPER_CHUNK_TARGET_CHARS=350
PIPER_CHUNK_MIN_CHARS=120
PIPER_CHUNK_MAX_CHARS=700
```

The splitter packs paragraphs and falls back to sentence/clause/whitespace boundaries; `target_chars` is the preferred chunk size, not a hard cap. `min_chars` and `max_chars` define the operating range. Short text naturally becomes a single chunk. Validation happens at startup — if `min > target > max` is violated the process refuses to start.

**Proxy buffering caveat.** The chunked endpoint relies on the server flushing each NDJSON line immediately. Reverse proxies that buffer responses (nginx by default, some Cloudflare/Coolify setups) will hold the entire stream until completion, defeating the latency benefit. The endpoint already sets `X-Accel-Buffering: no` for nginx-compatible proxies; if you front the engine with a different proxy, ensure response buffering is disabled on the `/speak/chunks` route. Verify from the shell with:

```bash
curl -N -X POST https://your-engine/speak/chunks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"texto largo...","model":"es_MX-ald-medium"}'
```

If all lines arrive at once after a long pause, the proxy is buffering.

`PIPER_MODEL_NAMES` can be a JSON array or a comma-separated list:

```env
PIPER_MODEL_NAMES=["es_MX-claude-high","es_MX-ald-medium"]
```

```env
PIPER_MODEL_NAMES=es_MX-claude-high,es_MX-ald-medium
```

Each name must follow Piper's model naming format:

```text
language_COUNTRY-voice-quality
```

Example with `es_MX-claude-high`:

```text
language = es
country = MX
voice = claude
quality = high
```

That pattern automatically generates the URL:

```text
{PIPER_HF_BASE}/es/es_MX/claude/high/es_MX-claude-high.onnx
```

## Run

```bash
python -m piper_sandbox.api
```

With the default configuration, open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The web GUI lets you type text, choose a model, and play the generated audio. Press `Ctrl+Enter` or the `Hablar` button.

### Run Everything Together

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=both
```

```bash
python -m piper_sandbox.api
```

This serves:

- GUI: `GET /`
- Engine: `GET /models`, `POST /speak`

### Run Engine Only

Use this on the server that has Piper installed and enough CPU/RAM for TTS generation.

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=engine
PIPER_HOST=0.0.0.0
PIPER_PORT=8000
PIPER_CORS_ORIGIN=*
```

```bash
python -m piper_sandbox.api
```

This exposes only:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /models`
- `POST /speak`

### Run GUI Only

Use this on any PC or small server. It does not need Piper installed because it delegates synthesis to the remote engine.

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=gui
PIPER_ENGINE_URL=https://tts-engine.example.com
```

```bash
python -m piper_sandbox.api
```

This exposes only:

- `GET /`
- `GET /health`

## Endpoints

### `GET /health`

Health check for servers and Docker.

Response:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "mode": "both",
  "engine": true,
  "gui": true,
  "chunks_enabled": false
}
```

`chunks_enabled` is `true` only when the engine is enabled in this process *and* `PIPER_CHUNKS_ENABLED=true`. GUI clients should read this field to decide whether to call `/speak` or `/speak/chunks`.

### `GET /models`

Lists the models available in this app. Available in `both` and `engine` modes.

Example:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/models
```

### `POST /speak`

Generates WAV audio. Receives JSON with `text` and `model`. Available in `both` and `engine` modes.

Example:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/speak \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Hola desde Piper","model":"es_MX-ald-medium"}' \
  --output salida.wav
```

Successful response:

```text
Content-Type: audio/wav
```

### `POST /speak/chunks`

Streams long text as a sequence of synthesized audio chunks, so the client can start playing chunk 0 before the rest finish synthesizing. Available in `both` and `engine` modes when `PIPER_CHUNKS_ENABLED=true`. Returns `501 Not Implemented` if the feature flag is off.

Request body is identical to `/speak`:

```json
{"text": "Texto largo...", "model": "es_MX-ald-medium"}
```

Response is `application/x-ndjson` — one JSON object per line, flushed as each chunk is ready:

```text
{"type":"meta","model":"es_MX-ald-medium","chunks":3,"target_chars":350,"min_chars":120,"max_chars":700}
{"type":"chunk","index":0,"chars":318,"split_reason":"sentence","synthesis_seconds":1.42,"duration_seconds":8.21,"rtf":0.17,"audio_base64":"UklGRg..."}
{"type":"chunk","index":1, ...}
{"type":"chunk","index":2, ...}
{"type":"done"}
```

Each `chunk.audio_base64` is a complete WAV (header + samples) base64-encoded. Decode and play in order.

Original chunk text is omitted by default to save bandwidth. Pass `?include_text=1` to include the `text` field in each chunk event.

If synthesis fails partway through, the server emits an in-band error event instead of `done` and closes the stream:

```text
{"type":"error","index":2,"message":"..."}
```

Pre-stream errors (invalid JSON, empty text, unknown model) return HTTP `400` before any NDJSON is written.

Test from the shell:

```bash
curl -N -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/speak/chunks \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"Texto suficientemente largo para producir varios chunks...","model":"es_MX-ald-medium"}'
```

Pass `-N` (`--no-buffer`) to see lines arrive progressively.

### `GET /`

Shows the web GUI in `both` and `gui` modes.

If the GUI is disabled, it returns `404` with `GUI is disabled`.

## Library Usage

```python
from piper_sandbox import PiperEngine

engine = PiperEngine()
engine.synthesize_to_file(
    "Hola, esta es una prueba.",
    "salida.wav",
    model="es_MX-ald-medium",
)
```

## Wyoming Piper

The included API generates WAV files using the `piper` binary. There is also a small wrapper for starting `wyoming-piper` if you install it separately.

```python
from piper_sandbox import WyomingPiperService

service = WyomingPiperService(voice="es_MX-ald-medium")
service.start()
```

Approximate terminal equivalent:

```bash
wyoming-piper \
  --uri tcp://127.0.0.1:10200 \
  --voice es_MX-ald-medium \
  --data-dir models/wyoming-piper \
  --download-dir models/wyoming-piper
```

## Docker

Build and run with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

Run engine only in Docker:

```bash
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=engine PIPER_INSTALL_TARGET='.[tts]' docker compose up --build
```

Run GUI only in Docker and connect it to a remote engine:

```bash
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=gui PIPER_INSTALL_TARGET=. PIPER_ENGINE_URL=https://tts-engine.example.com docker compose up --build
```

`PIPER_INSTALL_TARGET` controls what is installed at image build time:

- `.[tts]`: installs the app plus `piper-tts`; use this for `both` or `engine` mode.
- `.`: installs only the app; use this for `gui` mode when synthesis happens on a remote engine.

Models are stored in the `piper-models` volume when the engine is enabled.

## Coolify With GitHub Apps

Recommended steps:

1. Push this project to a GitHub repository.
2. In Coolify, create a new resource from GitHub Apps.
3. Select the repository.
4. Choose deployment with `Docker Compose`.
5. Use the included `docker-compose.yml` file.
6. Configure environment variables if you want to change behavior.

Useful variables for Coolify:

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=both
PIPER_DEFAULT_MODEL=es_MX-ald-medium
PIPER_MODEL_NAMES=["es_MX-claude-high","es_MX-ald-medium","es_ES-carlfm-x_low"]
```

Coolify usually provides the public domain and external proxy. The container listens on `0.0.0.0:8000`.

If you want it as a public API only, use:

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=engine
```

If you want a GUI-only deployment that points to another engine server, use:

```env
PIPER_SERVICE_MODE=gui
PIPER_ENGINE_URL=https://tts-engine.example.com
```

## Included Models

- `es_MX-ald-medium`: Spanish Mexico, recommended for Latin American testing.
- `es_ES-carlfm-x_low`: Spanish Spain, lightweight alternative.
